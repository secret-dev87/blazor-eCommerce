@page "/"

<PageTitle>My Shop</PageTitle>

@*Products model was used to create ProductList
Where I created a mock list of products.
By creating the ProductList in Shared folder
I enabled a possibility to put one word here "<ProductList/>"
In order to depict the whole List
Instead of writing a lot of code inside of the Index page*@
<ProductList />
